/**
 * The single brand surface.
 *
 * Every placement — the sidebar, the mobile header, the public/login frame —
 * renders through this module, so the Campus+ identity is defined once and the
 * mark never drifts between screens.
 *
 * ── Identity vs context ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The product mark is Campus+ (the plus tile below) — it is the app identity
 * and the app icon. The college crest is a separate slot with its own rules
 * (see `CollegeCrest`): it says who the product is *for*, never what it is.
 *
 * Swapping the mark: put the asset in `public/brand/`, point `LOGO_SRC` at it
 * and every placement follows, at three responsive sizes, with the original
 * proportions preserved (`object-fit: contain`). `LOGO_PLATE` renders a raster
 * mark on a soft white plate when the artwork ships on its own background.

/**
 * The college crest — context, not identity.
 *
 * Campus+ keeps its own mark as the product identity (and as the app icon).
 * The crest belongs exactly where the product states who it is *for*: the
 * sign-in brand area, the sidebar's affiliation line and the public footer.
 * It always renders next to the words that keep the positioning honest —
 * "unofficial student project" / "not affiliated with PCCOE" — so it reads as
 * context rather than endorsement.
 *
 * The supplied crest is `public/brand/pccoe-crest.webp` (300x300, opaque
 * white background), which is why it renders on a plate with the corners
 * clipped to the disc. Clearing `CREST_SRC` hides the crest everywhere —
 * no empty plate, no placeholder.
 *
 * `MIN_SIZE` is a legibility floor, not a style preference: the artwork
 * carries a torch, an open book, a motto ribbon, five lines of type and a
 * "Since 1999" line, and rendered at 28px it is an unreadable smudge. Below
 * roughly 44px the crest stops being an identity cue and becomes noise, so it
 * is only placed where it can be shown at or above that size.
